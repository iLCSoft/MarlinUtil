  - Adds SelectNthEventsProcessor.
  - This sets its own processor ReturnValue to true or false, depending on chosen parameters, which can be used in the Marlin steering file to use a particular sub-set of a sample.
  - Via the InvertSelection parameter this can be easily inverted, which is convenient for training vs. inference of ML models.

    - The CMake configuration allows to either build Catch2 on the fly or to discover a suitable installation of Catch2
  - Add the existing test and an example unittest to the test suit that can be run via `ctest` after building the package.
  - Disable building the tests for the coverity workflow for now to avoid polluting the output of that with Catch2 issues

  - Introduce a `HelixClassT` template class and make `HelixClass` and `HellixClass_double` typedefs of this class, instead of having two separate (but practically identical) implementations that are in place currently.
    - Explicitly instantiate both versions that were in place previously to make sure things don't break downstream.
    - Mark getters as `const`

* 2022-09-19 Carl Mikael Berggren ([PR#28](https://github.com/iLCSoft/MarlinUtil/pull/28))

* 2018-04-20 Erica Brondolin ([PR#11](https://github.com/iLCSoft/MarlinUtil/pull/11))
  - This PR is related to a detector issue discussed in: https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep/issues/356
  Given that the return value of det.field().isValid() is always true for design, a different approach on the check of the geometry validity is applied.

# v01-04

    New features:

        - MarlinCED: 
	        - added more subdetectors: FTD, LHCal, LCal, Coil, Yoke, SIT

	        - changed detector colors to match the default colors used in Mokka
     
            - detector components have now layers and layer description

            - Cylinder: inner edges can be different from outeredges, and the inner
                cylinder can be rotated with an other angle as the outer cylinder shape

            - made compatible with CLIC (no LHCal and 11 FTD layers):
               LHCal is now optional and the FTD is drawn dynamically from gear....


         To use the new CED features use CED_GeoTube instead of CED_GeoCylinder.


        - added ILDCellIDEncoding which is needed for development of new tracking
          system, could be removed at a later stage of development

        - header files now installed into subdirectory (marlinutil) to avoid name clashes
            still backwards compatible

        - moved classes FPCCDData and FPCCDPixelHit from MarlinReco
          to MarlinUtil to avoid dependency of Overlay on MarlinReco

    Fixes:
    
        - MarlinCED:
            - old ced_hit_id is now deprecated (the old ced_hit_id used one int to store type and layer number).
	            The new one have one argument more, (layer and type are now 2 fields)
            - Added try/catch blocks to prevent gear::UnknownParameterException, while accessing undefined detector components.
            - fixed drawGEARDetector
            - fixed length of VXD detector ( had used half size only !)
            - allow to toggle visibility of VXD
            - made compatible with new gear (used for ILD_01):
            - use optionally FTDParameters
            - use size of SIT arrays (will have to be changed to ZPlanarLayout)
            - optionally use new coil parameter names



# v01-03

    - Changes (A. Sailer):
        
        - Rewrote the fast HelixClass::getDistanceToPoint

        - Remove unnecessary code from HelixClass:getDistanceToPoint,
            add second getDistanceToPoint function, that stops if distXY is
            larger than given distance, keeps cpu intensive functions from being run.


# v01-02

    - Changes (H. Hoelbe, DESY):
        - Implement remote access to CED:

            * Now you are able to connect to an user defined host and portnumber.

            * Example: To run CED on host "foo" port 7777 and Marlin on host "bar":
                      ssh foo
                      export CED_PORT="7777"
                      glced --trust bar

                      ssh bar
                      export CED_HOST="foo"
                      export CED_PORT="7777"
                      Marlin viewer.xml

    - Simplified cmake scripts

            - removed dependencies GEAR, LCIO and streamlog (now exported through Marlin)
            - exchanged CMakeModules dependency with new package ILCUTIL


# v01-01

       Changes (H. Hoelbe, DESY):
    -  New methods: MarlinCED::set_layer_description and

       layer descriptions and call ced_describe_layer only 
       one time per layer.
    -  Add usleep to the mainloop to avoid busy waiting
       (speed up CED)
    - CalorimeterHitType - added functions:
         CHT::Layout layoutFromString(const std::string& name) ;
         CHT::CaloID caloIDFromString(const std::string& name) ;
      (moved from MarlinReco/LDCCaloDigi/src/CHT_helper)
